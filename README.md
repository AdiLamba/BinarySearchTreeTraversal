•	Developed a BST implementation in C to manage hierarchical data structures efficiently (insertion, deletion, traversal and search operations)
•	Optimized memory usage with dynamic memory allocation for creating and managing tree nodes
•	Performed Big-O complexity analysis for all major algorithms, demonstrating efficiency in search and other tree operations
•	Debugged and tested the program with edge cases, including handling of empty trees, single-node trees, and deletion scenarios with one or two children
